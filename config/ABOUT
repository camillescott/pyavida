genarch
-------

All runs are to 100000 updates, saving population every 50 generations,
with implicit repro and reward for ANDN. Treatments are:

1. genarch_A_*

* per-site on divide sub, del, ins mutations, ranging from .0015 to .0045
* per genome max one del, ins mutations, ranging .03 to .09 (covarying with per-site)

2. genarch_B_*

* per genome max one sub, del, ins mutations ranging .03 to .09
